<h2>  MY ACHIEVEMENT </h2>

<br> Achievement is a thing done successful with effort skill and courage. "To reach this stage is a great achievement ".</br>
<br>  Achievement is something of success. No one has ever achieve greatness without dream, every achievement in life is a dream.</br>
<br> My achievement take place when I was in 200 level, though I was an average student during my first year in kwara state university,</br>
<br> I did not take my education serious, then I was called to a seminar then,then there was this lecturer that lectured us about the definition of education,</br>
<br> since then I became determined and I put in more effort with the fate in me and the assistance of almighty Allah. I started going to tutorials, night class,<br>
<br> I browse and search online for assignment  and then I saw changes in me.I gained more academically then I started lessen my friends because they influence me negatively</br>
<br> Then, my parent noticed the changes in me, they were so proud of my academic then they bought me a laptop, I was so happy that I said I will even do more to impress them likewise myself. </br>
<br> My achievement was made from my determination.</br>
